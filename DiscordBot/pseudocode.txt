create some structure of past moderated items for reports that violate guidelines

When the moderator sends some message like “Moderate” then the following will happen:
While the report queue is not empty:
	Print out a summary of the report in the format that my current version already does (reported by: against: abuse type:)
	Ask if the message is in violation of any of our community guidelines
	If message violates guidelines:
		Ask if the message is threatening to share/sharing nude images?
		If it is threatening to share:
			Ask if the message is in violation of Federal laws?
			If in violation of federal laws:
				Ask: are you ready to move forward with sending a report to the authorities? Reply with yes/cancel
				If yes, wanting to report:
					Simulate reporting by saying in mod channel: “Report sent”
					Simulate removing the offender user’s message by DMing the offender that their message (with message linked) has been taken down)
					Simulate banning the offender user by DMing the offender saying that they have been banned 
					GoTo END OF LOOP
                If cancel:
                    GoTo TAKEDOWN
		
		Else (If it isn’t threatening to share/sharing nude images):
			Ask which of the following guidelines are in violation (TODO add in violations)
            If the moderator selects None, GoTo END OF LOOP
            Ask if the message is in violation of Federal laws?
			    If in violation of federal laws:
                Ask: are you ready to move forward with sending a report to the authorities? Reply with yes/cancel
				If yes, wanting to report:
					Simulate reporting by saying in mod channel: “Report sent”
					Simulate removing the offender user’s message by DMing the offender that their message (with message linked) has been taken down)
					Simulate banning the offender user by DMing the offender saying that they have been banned 
					GoTo END OF LOOP
                If cancel:
                    GoTo TAKEDOWN


        
        TAKEDOWN:
        Simulate removing the offender user’s message by DMing the offender that their message (with message linked) has been taken down)
        Ask: what actions, if any, should we take against this user? Options: a) permanently ban, b) suspend for 1 wk, c) mute account for 1 day, d) No further action
        Case a: simulate by DMing the offender "you've been banned permanently."
        Case b: Simulate by DMing the offender "your account has been suspended for one week."
        Case c: Simulate by DMing the offender "your account has been muted for one day".
        Case d: Nothing
        GoTo END OF LOOP 

	Else (if message doesn't violate guidelines):
        Say: Marking report as resolved.
        GoTo END OF LOOP
	
	
	END OF LOOP:
	Ask if moderator would like to continue going through reports? 
	If no:
		Break out of loop

Say: All done moderating! Thank you for helping keep our community safe.
